# Software-Defined-Wireless-Sensor-Network


##We have built a software-defined wireless sensor network (SDWSN) platform to control the sensor nodes in a centralized manner. The platform consists of two components - sensor nodes and SDN controller. The SDN controller defines control policies to be deployed at the sensor nodes. Accordingly, the sensor nodes act in the network. Thus, we have a better network management, while leveraging the global view of the network through the concept of SDN.&#34;
